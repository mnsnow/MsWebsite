    <h3>Shade Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      Shade is one of the Six Heroes who successfully defeated the Black Mage many eons past. During that climactic battle, Shade sacrificed himself in order to activate the seals that bound the villainous Mage. Like so many of the Six Heroes, Shade's efforts were lost to time, and no record of his bravery remains in any Maple history books. Now, thanks to the efforts of the Point-Ear Foxes native to Miu Miu, a region of Grandis, Shade has been reborn. In a world that feels alien and strange, Shade must chart a new path for himself while investigating claims that his nemesis has returned... Shade uses Strength as his main stat and is armed with Knuckles as his primary weapon and Fox Marbles as his secondary. Shade can summon spirits to aid him in battle and can boost his stats with special skills. Different spirits have different strengths and support Shade in different ways. With Ground Pound, you can call upon a nature spirit to punch the earth and damage multiple enemies with a powerful shockwave. Use Blade Spiritâ€”Forward Slash to summon a blade spirit that will pull multiple enemies toward you and wreck them with a fierce flurry of blows. Take control of Shade and rewrite history...
