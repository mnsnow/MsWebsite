    <h3>Zero Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      Alpha was raised from birth to lead the legendary order of Shadow Knights, protectors of the land of Shadowvale, until he learned that he was living a lie. The friends and mentors that had raised him were hiding an insidious plot to keep him locked away in Mirror World, a realm of magic created by one of the Black Mage’s loyal commanders. Though he did not yet know it, Alpha was far more important than he was led to believe. It wasn't until he got a glimpse of Beta, his female counterpart, that he understood his true destiny. Separate they are nothing, but together they are the Child of the Goddess. Choosing Zero means you get two characters in one. However, Zero is recommended for advanced players as they start at level 100 and are more difficult to master than your average Warrior or Bowman. Zero uses Time Force instead of Mana, and Alpha and Beta both have their own HP and Time Force meters, meaning you can swap them out if one is hurting. Alpha and Beta can also join forces for Dual Combat and obliterate enemies. They are armed with unique weapons that evolve over time—the swords Lapis and Lazuli.
